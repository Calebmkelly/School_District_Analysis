# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis: 
This analysis will provide an overview of school district data that has been disected through the use of Python and the Pandas Library. Through the ananlysis of this data can trends be uncovered and presented about school preformance. Key metrics for each school will be created, these metrics will include: Top 5 and bottom 5 preforming schools, based on overall passing rate; The average math and reading scores recieved by students in each grade level at each school; and school preformance based on: budget per student, school size, and type of school. in addition, evidence of academic dishonesty is suspected within "Thomas High School", and the task of replacing Ninth Grade math and reading scores within "Thomas High School" to "NaN" is at hand. Afterwards a comparison of the data will be established.
